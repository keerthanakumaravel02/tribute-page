					<p class="text-left">We can say without a semblance of doubt that she was a woman who had an interesting life. She was courious, intelligent and talented. She travelled and changed residence many times from a young age. She was the first to do many things on the big screen when films were still made in black and white: she was a star. But she also had a great and resourceful mind, that made her learn from everything available around her; she did experiments and made inventions. One of which is very present in our daily life nowadays.

					<br>
					<h4>Some facts about her:</h4>
					<ul>
						<li>She was a Film Star from 1930's to 1950's</li>
						<li>Hedy was often known as: “The Most Beautiful Woman in Films” </li>
